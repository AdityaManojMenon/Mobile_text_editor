# mobile_text_editor
We take the word completion for granted. Our phones, text editors, and word processing programs all provide suggestions for how to complete words as we type based on the letters typed so far. These hints help speed up user input and eliminate common typographical mistakes 
We will implement two functions that such tools might use to provide command completion. The first function, fill_completions, will construct a dictionary designed to permit easy calculation of possible word completions. A problem for any such function is what vocabulary, or set of words, to allow completion on. Because the vocabulary you want may depend on the domain a tool is used in, you will provide fill_completions with a representative sample of documents from which it will build the completions dictionary (we provide the file ap_docs.txt). The second function, find_completions, will return the set of possible completions for a prefix of any word in the vocabulary (or the empty set if there are none). In addition to these two functions, you need a function to open a file, and will implement a simple driver program to use for testing your functions.
